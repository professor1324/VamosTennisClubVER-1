The website is to promote tennis and also foster a community of liked minded people who love and are enthusiastic about tennis.

As a person who often watches tennis matches and is also very interested about the sport, this topic is thus relevant to me. as a person who joins 
various clubs, promoting a community which is tight knit and filled with people who are passionate and enthusiastic about what they do really inspires
me. I also look at Apple's website and was fascinated by its asthetics.

the embedded code inside provides alternate way of conveying visual information such as pictures to the visually impaired through describing the image
with simple keywords.

i learn alot of problem solving skills and the ability to think critically. This is especially true when i am trying to figure out where the code went
 wrong. From my experience, CSS could be a little abstract at times, but by not giving up and pulling through this project really gave me a really
enriching experience that is hard to replicate.

i think the overall asthetics are alright, however theres still alot of rooms of improvement. One such area is how to make my website footer even more 
responsive as i feel theres still some unresponsive portions, which is really hard to do.

i did use alot of good looking fonts from google's API.
